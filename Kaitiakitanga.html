<h3 class="dotted">What is my website</h3>
<p class="dotted">This website is to promote kaitiakitanga and help stop pollution in our surrounding environment. My website is called 3R which stands for reduce, reuse, recycle these acronyms help prevent pollution. The first R which is reduce means decreasing the usage of plastic bags and fossil fuels as these are the main input towards pollution. The second R is reuse, being able to reuse plastic would greatly reduce waste and create an environmental impact. The last R is recycle, recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new reusable materials for example plastic bottles can be made into clothing by turning it into polyester fibers. If we don’t use these 3R’s to help stop pollution it could increase and get worse in the future. The harmful effects of pollution can cause health issues such as respiratory issues, cardiovascular problems such as heart attacks, strokes and more, also increase risk of lung cancer and other cancers. Air pollution contributes to global warming and climate change leading to rise of sea level, extreme weather events and change in ecosystem. Water pollution can cause harm to sea life, marine ecosystems and disrupt food chains. </p>
