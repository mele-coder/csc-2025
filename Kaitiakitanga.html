<h3>What is my website?</h3>
<p>This website is to promote kaitiakitanga and help stop pollution in our surrounding environment. My website is called 3R which stands for reduce, reuse, recycle these acronyms help prevent pollution. The first R which is reduce means decreasing the usage of plastic bags and fossil fuels as these are the main input towards pollution. The second R is reuse, being able to reuse plastic would greatly reduce waste and create an environmental impact. The last R is recycle, recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new reusable materials for example plastic bottles can be made into clothing by turning it into polyester fibers. If we don’t use these 3R’s to help stop pollution it could increase and get worse in the future. The harmful effects of pollution can cause health issues such as respiratory issues, cardiovascular problems such as heart attacks, strokes and more, also increase risk of lung cancer and other cancers. We need to make a stop to this in order to protect our ecosystem, animals, human health and secure a sustainable future for the future generation. Through this website we’ll be exploring the main 3 types of pollution around the world which are air pollution, water pollution and land pollution. Overall through this website I want to promote kaitiakitanga. Kaitiakitanga comes from the Maori word usually meaning guardianship or protection over the environment, it emphasises the importance of humans conserving the environment and having a responsibility in keeping the environment safe for future generations. It talks about the connection between humans and nature to maintain a balance and harmony between one another.</p>
