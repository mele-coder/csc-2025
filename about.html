<h3 class="dotted">What is air pollution?</h3>
<p class="dotted">Air pollution is the contamination of toxic substances in the surrounding air that is damaging the environment, animals,and humans. This is a global issue around the world but some regions and countries have rather higher levels of pollution for example countries in Asia for instance Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, and Tajikistan it has it worse. Air pollution is caused by the range of human activities and natural sources. For instance burning fossil fuels for energy, industrial processes, transportation, and agriculture. As well as natural sources including volcanic eruptions which releases a mix of harmful gases and ash into the air, also wildfires releases toxic chemicals into the air affecting the lungs and heart also dust storms causes air pollution it reduces the quality of the air by releasing large amounts of soil and particulate matter from the ground into the air. This can cause harmful effects on the environment as well as humans, air pollution contributes to global warming and climate change leading to rise of sea level, extreme weather events and change in ecosystem. It can also cause health issues like respiratory illnesses (affecting your breathing and oxygen intake), increases risk of heart attacks and strokes, also impacting the nervous system (in charge of sending messages between the brain and body in order to function properly) and immune system (in order to protect the body from illnesses and infections). Thereâ€™s a higher risk for children, elderly and people who have health conditions to be affected by this. It also reduces biodiversity impacting wildlife populations and their ecosystem. </p>
